EJSApp Collab Session 1.0

This is the first release of the ejsapp_collab_session plugin.
This plugin lets you to create sessions for collaborative working with Java applets created 
with Easy Java Simulations (EJS) and added to your Moodle course by means of the ejsapp 
module.
The Java applets should be compiled with version 4.37 (build 20120715 or later) of EJS to 
properly work.

This is a block plugin for Moodle so you should place the ejsapp_collab_session folder in 
your /blocks folder, inside you Moodle installation.
This block has been tested in Moodle versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3.

This block needs the ejsapp module to be of any use. It works with version 1.0 (or later) of
EJSApp.
You can find and download it at the plugins section in the Moodle.org webpage or at
https://github.com/UNEDLabs.

An explanation of EJSApp and EJSApp Collab Session is included in the folder "doc". There, 
you will also find a txt file with relevant links.
